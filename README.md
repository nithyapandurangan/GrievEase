# GrievEase

GrievEase aims to simplify the grievance submission process, streamline complaint routing, and ensure timely resolution of the grievances and issues faced by college students.
We also integrated sentiment analysis and deep learning fundamentals to assess the mental well-being of the students and help them out if necessary. By analyzing the text input for indicators of distress, such as phrases suggesting thoughts of depression or self-harm, the system aims to identify individuals in need of support.
